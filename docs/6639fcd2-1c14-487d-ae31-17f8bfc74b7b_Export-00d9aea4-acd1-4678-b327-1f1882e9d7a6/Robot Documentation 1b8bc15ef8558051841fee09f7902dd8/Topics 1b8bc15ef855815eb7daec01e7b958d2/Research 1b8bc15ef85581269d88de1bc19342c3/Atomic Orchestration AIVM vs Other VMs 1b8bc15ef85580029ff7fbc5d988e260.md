# Atomic Orchestration: AIVM vs Other VMs

# Solana and Sui

## Pre-determined transaction data for parallel execution

Both Solana and Sui require transactions to declare all the state data (accounts or objects) they will touch ahead of time to enable safe parallelism. In Solana’s Sealevel runtime, each transaction lists the accounts it will read/write before execution, allowing non-overlapping transactions to run concurrently ￼. Similarly, Sui’s object-centric model forces every object used in a transaction to be specified in the transaction input. This explicit encoding of dependencies lets Sui execute independent transactions in parallel. The upshot is that the blockchain can schedule transactions in parallel only when their data access is known in advance, avoiding conflicts.

## Impact on real-time AI-driven automation

This static upfront requirement can constrain real-time, dynamic automation by on-chain AI. An AI agent or smart contract on Solana/Sui cannot spontaneously read or affect new state that wasn’t pre-declared, meaning it can’t adapt on the fly to data that emerges mid-execution. All relevant accounts/objects must be decided beforehand. If an AI-driven process needs to react to unpredictable events or fetch new info during execution, it would be forced into multiple transactions (with off-chain logic in between), rather than one atomic on-chain action. In essence, Solana and Sui’s execution model favors determinism and parallel throughput over flexibility – a trade-off that could hinder real-time AI automation that requires on-the-spot decisions. Solana’s programs, for example, can only access data that was loaded into the transaction at launch; an on-chain program cannot pull in additional accounts once execution has started ￼. This ensures determinism but means an AI can’t, say, query a new contract mid-transaction based on some newly computed insight.

## Handling dynamic state changes

Both protocols enforce consistency by disallowing unexpected state access and carefully ordering any conflicting transactions. In Solana, the runtime will prevent two transactions that write to the same account from executing in parallel – they’ll be serialized or one will fail, preserving atomicity. Each transaction sees a snapshot of its specified accounts, and any changes to those accounts from earlier transactions are visible only if those transactions executed first (otherwise, conflicts are resolved by not running them concurrently). In Sui, if a transaction involves a shared object (global state that many might use), it cannot be run in parallel with other transactions on that same object – those go through consensus and execute sequentially. Only transactions on independent objects bypass global consensus and run truly concurrently. This means dynamic state changes (e.g. two actors trying to update the same asset at once) are handled by falling back to ordering one after the other. Neither Solana nor Sui allows a single transaction’s scope to dynamically expand during execution – any state not pre-included is off-limits, and any unforeseen contention with other transactions will be resolved by scheduling (or aborting) rather than letting state updates conflict.

## **Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from fixed data fixation**

This fixed transaction data fixation renders these blockchains vulnerable to mid-execution state changes, either naturally occurring or maliciously induced. An arbitrage orchestrated via sequential transactions becomes susceptible to price fluctuations or state manipulations mid-process. Additionally, partial completion of multi-step orchestrations due to non-atomic transactions creates exposure to MEV attacks, front-running, and unintended execution failures. Furthermore, pre-defined data significantly restricts the blockchain’s adaptability, limiting responsiveness to emergent opportunities and compromising security.

# Ethereum and Avalanche

## Publicly available ABIs

In Ethereum (and similarly on Avalanche’s C-Chain, which inherits the EVM model), only a minority of smart contracts have their Application Binary Interface (ABI) openly available – typically those whose source code has been verified and published on explorers like Etherscan or SnowTrace. The vast majority of deployed contracts do not expose an ABI publicly. In fact, studies indicate over 99% of Ethereum contracts have never released their source code (and by extension, no public ABI), leaving only a tiny percentage with human-readable interfaces￼. 

Avalanche’s default chain doesn’t inherently improve this statistic, as it relies on the same voluntary verification process. This means an AI agent looking to interact with arbitrary contracts is often flying blind without an ABI, unless developers have provided that metadata. In practice, AI-driven orchestration on Ethereum/Avalanche would be mostly limited to known contracts with published ABIs or require off-chain ABI reverse-engineering.

## Deterministic AI-driven orchestration limits

Ethereum and Avalanche’s architectures were not designed with native AI orchestration in mind, and they impose certain deterministic but rigid patterns that an AI must work within. Both use a globally sequential execution of transactions (Ethereum’s single-threaded EVM execution, and Avalanche’s Snowman consensus ordering on its C-Chain), so complex multi-contract workflows have to be broken into discrete transactions or encoded into a single contract call. There is no built-in scheduler or multi-step transaction framework in the base protocol that an AI can leverage for “deterministic orchestration” across contracts – any orchestration logic must be handled at the smart contract or application layer. 

For example, an AI agent could deploy an Ethereum smart contract that calls a series of other contracts in one transaction (achieving atomicity for that sequence), but it would need all those contract ABIs and to predefine the call sequence. Or, the AI could send multiple transactions and try to coordinate them, but then it’s subject to network latency, mempool ordering, and other actors’ interference. The net effect is that while the outcome of a single transaction is deterministic, orchestrating longer sequences of actions deterministically is challenging. Each transaction’s state changes finalize before the next begins, and interleaving external data or triggers in the middle isn’t possible without breaking out to off-chain logic. 

In short, Ethereum and Avalanche provide a stable, deterministic execution for individual transactions, but they inherently limit an AI’s ability to coordinate complex, stateful workflows in a single, seamless operation. Any cross-contract or multi-step AI-driven process will either be one atomic transaction (if pre-planned and encoded) or will require off-chain coordination (sacrificing atomicity).

## Real-time data access for AI applications

On-chain contracts on Ethereum and Avalanche cannot directly access real-time external data or make network calls in the midst of execution. All information used by a smart contract must be on-chain (either already stored in state or provided as part of the transaction call data). This is a deliberate design for determinism – every node must see the same inputs and compute the same result. Consequently, any off-chain data needed (prices, sensor readings, AI model outputs, etc.) has to be fed on-chain via oracles or external transactions. 

“Ethereum contracts cannot communicate directly with the outside world,” as the classic oracle problem statement goes￼. They rely on oracle services (like Chainlink or custom feeders) to push in data at intervals. This means an AI application that needs up-to-the-moment information (say, a latest market price or an IoT sensor reading) can’t pull that data in real-time during a contract’s execution – it must wait for an oracle update transaction that delivers the data to the blockchain.

Avalanche’s contracts share this limitation, as they run the EVM; they too must use oracles for fresh data. There’s also no native mechanism for continuous real-time computation on-chain – contracts execute only when triggered by a transaction, and then they run to completion. For AI use cases, this implies that any real-time processing loop or reactive behavior has to be implemented with a series of transactions and off-chain components. 

In summary, Ethereum and Avalanche ensure deterministic execution and state consistency but at the cost of needing off-chain assistance for live data and any ongoing autonomous activity. AI agents on these platforms typically operate by observing on-chain state and submitting transactions (much like a human user would), rather than by residing on-chain and reacting instantaneously.

## **Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from sequential execution**

Sequential execution allows intervening state changes, exposing orchestrations to external manipulation, price fluctuations, or malicious front-running between sequential steps. The lack of atomicity across multi-transaction orchestrations increases vulnerability to MEV exploits, front-running, and partial transaction failures. Additionally, sequential, rigid execution prevents dynamic adaptation mid-orchestration, limiting the efficiency and security of real-time AI-driven actions, especially in complex scenarios like arbitrage or treasury management.

# Near Protocol

## Claimed AI capabilities

NEAR Protocol has positioned itself as “the Blockchain for AI”, touting features and infrastructure aimed at AI integration￼. Official materials highlight “AI-native transactions” and a vision of autonomous agents interacting with the chain. In practical terms, NEAR claims support for on-chain AI agents that can manage assets and execute tasks on behalf of users. For example, NEAR’s documentation and leadership describe scenarios of AI agents planning and performing complex actions – from buying items to executing cross-chain trades – autonomously, as well as managing user assets under set policies￼. 

One flagship initiative is NEAR’s development of “Shade Agents,” which leverage trusted execution environments (TEE) for AI computations. These Shade Agents are essentially a network of secure nodes that can run arbitrary machine learning models or heavy computations off-chain in a verifiable, confidential manner￼. The results from these computations can then be validated and used on-chain, combining off-chain AI power with on-chain trust. In short, NEAR is building an ecosystem where AI-driven dApps can thrive: it markets itself as AI-ready, with features like a sharded, scalable runtime for high throughput, and specialized frameworks (like an AI Assistant and an Agent Protocol) to ease development of AI agents. NEAR’s website explicitly mentions “AI agents manage assets and services autonomously,” underscoring its intent to natively support autonomous automation￼. This goes hand-in-hand with tools like NEAR’s Intent Framework (for abstracting cross-chain operations) and NEAR.AI (an initiative for open AI models on NEAR) to attract AI developers.

## AI integration vs. The Robot Blockchain’s deterministic orchestration

NEAR’s approach to AI integration differs from The Robot Network’s deterministic orchestration and atomic execution. NEAR is essentially adding AI-friendly components around its core protocol – e.g. off-chain compute via Shade Agents, cross-chain intent handling, and giving AI agents the ability to submit transactions – but the actual smart contract execution on NEAR remains the typical deterministic but single-transaction model.

Complex AI tasks on NEAR might involve multiple steps: an off-chain agent (or TEE cluster) plans or computes, then on-chain contracts execute moves (with each transaction being atomic). By contrast, since The Robot Network’s deterministic orchestration allows it to coordinate multi-step AI-driven workflows entirely within the blockchain environment in a predictable sequence, it means that The Robot Network can execute an AI agent’s series of actions atomically (all-or-nothing) and under consensus, rather than relying on off-chain components between steps. 

NEAR’s AI agents, while powerful, do not all run within the on-chain VM from start to finish – they often operate as off-chain services that trigger on-chain transactions. The use of TEEs on NEAR underscores this: heavy AI computations are done off-chain (albeit in a verifiable way) and then the outcome is injected on-chain￼. This is a different design philosophy from a blockchain that would run the AI logic on-chain deterministically. Therefore, NEAR’s AI integration is more hybrid – combining on-chain and off-chain – whereas The Robot Network’s atomic execution keeps the entire process within the blockchain’s deterministic context. 

Also, NEAR’s focus is on scalability and flexibility (sharding, bridging, external compute) to accommodate AI, whereas The Robot Network’s atomic execution ensures that the AI-driven process is executed in one go under unified consensus. 

In summary, NEAR provides many tools for AI, but it doesn’t inherently make multi-step processes a single atomic unit across the chain and beyond – that is a distinguishing feature of The Robot Network design. NEAR’s advantage is in offering infrastructure for AI (sharded throughput, agent frameworks, etc.), but the trade-off is that it leans on external modules for orchestration, as opposed to a fully on-chain deterministic sequence of The Robot Network.

## Dynamic, real-time AI-driven automation on-chain

NEAR does not yet support dynamic real-time AI automation as a native on-chain service in the way one might imagine an AI agent continuously running on the blockchain. Like most chains, NEAR’s contracts execute in response to transactions and cannot initiate themselves on their own schedule. There’s no built-in cron-like trigger or continuously learning AI model running inside the NEAR runtime without external intervention. NEAR’s roadmap and ecosystem tools acknowledge this by providing external solutions: for instance, projects like CronCat (a scheduling DAO/tool) have been introduced to schedule contract calls on NEAR, indicating that timed or automated triggers come from add-ons rather than the base protocol. 

When NEAR speaks of “AI agents” managing things, those agents are essentially off-chain programs (or users running code) that utilize NEAR’s fast finality and cheap transactions to act quickly – but they still must submit transactions to effect change. In terms of real-time responsiveness, NEAR’s 1-2 second block finality is an improvement over slower chains, meaning an AI agent can react and get confirmation of an action within a couple of seconds, which is near real-time for many applications. However, this is not the same as the AI logic living on-chain and updating continuously in real-time. 

NEAR’s Shade Agents provide a form of real-time compute environment, but it’s off-chain (in a TEE cluster) and then feeds results on-chain in a verifiable way￼. Thus, while NEAR is AI-friendly, an AI-driven automation loop (sense-decide-act) still straddles off-chain and on-chain components. The on-chain part (NEAR smart contracts) remains deterministic and requires transactions to initiate changes, just like Ethereum or others. There is no native on-chain mechanism for an AI to, for example, continuously monitor a sensor feed and adjust itself every block without external input – that kind of “live” automation would require an external agent watching the sensor and sending transactions to NEAR. 

In contrast, a platform like The Robot Network, which supports deterministic orchestration and atomic execution natively, allows an AI routine to run as a sequence of on-chain steps triggered by on-chain events in one go. NEAR’s current offerings would require the AI to break that into parts, using off-chain triggers (even if automated) for each step. 

To summarize, NEAR greatly aids AI applications with its scalability and dedicated tooling (making it easier to integrate AI and blockchain), but it does not natively provide a fully on-chain, self-driving AI automation engine. Dynamic automation on NEAR is achieved via a combination of off-chain AI agents and fast on-chain transactions – not by the NEAR protocol itself spontaneously adapting on the fly without external prompts.

## **Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from Near’s sequential execution**

Sequential transactions expose orchestrations to potential intervening state changes or malicious manipulations, undermining orchestrations like arbitrage. The lack of native multi-step atomic execution creates opportunities for front-running, MEV exploits, and unintended partial executions. Additionally, sequential execution severely restricts dynamic adaptability mid-execution, reducing responsiveness and introducing inefficiencies, particularly in AI-driven contexts requiring adaptive decision-making.

# **Ritual Foundation**

## **Off-chain AI computation integrated via on-chain verification**

Ritual positions itself as an “AI-first blockchain,” but it’s crucial to clarify that Ritual does **not** execute AI computations directly within its blockchain runtime. Instead, Ritual employs off-chain AI execution through dedicated computational infrastructures such as **Infernet**—a decentralized network of specialized nodes running AI inference tasks. These nodes execute the computationally demanding AI workloads off-chain, subsequently returning results alongside cryptographic proofs or attestations. Smart contracts on Ritual validate these proofs on-chain before accepting the results into the blockchain state, creating a verified bridge between off-chain AI computation and on-chain state updates. Thus, Ritual’s AI functionality fundamentally relies on off-chain compute with on-chain verification, rather than truly native on-chain AI.

## **AI integration vs. The Robot Network deterministic orchestration**

Unlike The Robot Network’s fully deterministic, atomic orchestration model—which allows AI-driven workflows to dynamically adapt entirely within a single atomic on-chain execution—Ritual splits complex AI tasks into discrete off-chain computations. Ritual smart contracts can request off-chain AI tasks, wait asynchronously for off-chain processing, and later integrate verified results. However, this asynchronous, external computation approach means Ritual does not inherently achieve atomicity for multi-step AI workflows. Complex AI-driven tasks are fragmented into separate steps, each independently executed and verified off-chain before being committed on-chain. This contrasts sharply with The Robot Network’s ability to execute an entire multi-step AI-driven orchestration atomically within consensus, without external computational dependencies or breaks in the execution logic.

## **Dynamic, real-time AI-driven automation on-chain**

Ritual provides built-in tools such as scheduled transactions and native account abstraction to automate interactions with off-chain AI resources. Nevertheless, this automation does not imply real-time, dynamic on-chain adaptability during transaction execution itself. Ritual smart contracts cannot spontaneously adapt mid-execution based on new, previously unknown state data; instead, they depend on scheduled calls or triggered transactions returning pre-computed off-chain AI results at discrete intervals. While this provides powerful off-chain-enabled flexibility, it significantly differs from The Robot Network’s genuinely dynamic, real-time orchestration, which can autonomously query and respond to emerging on-chain state changes instantaneously within a single atomic transaction. Ritual’s “automation” thus remains fundamentally asynchronous and externally dependent, requiring discrete triggers rather than continuous, spontaneous on-chain decision-making.

## **Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from Ritual’s off-chain computation model**

Ritual’s reliance on off-chain AI introduces potential vulnerabilities associated with asynchronous computation. AI-driven orchestrations are vulnerable to latency between computation request and result verification, creating windows where intervening state changes (natural or malicious) can undermine expected outcomes. As Ritual’s model does not guarantee atomicity across multiple computation steps, it exposes orchestrations—especially sensitive operations such as arbitrage or treasury management—to front-running, MEV exploitation, or partial-execution failures. Furthermore, the separation of computation from consensus inherently limits responsiveness, potentially compromising Ritual’s adaptability and real-time efficacy in dynamic blockchain environments.

In short, Ritual provides a strong platform for securely integrating externally computed AI results onto the blockchain via cryptographic attestations, but fundamentally differs from The Robot Network’s atomic, real-time, deterministic, fully on-chain AI orchestration capability.

# **The Robot Network’s Unique Advantages**

The Robot Network uniquely provides fully integrated, dynamic real-time data access at execution via its NL Index. Unlike Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, Sui, Ritual and Near, The Robot Network enables deterministic, atomic orchestrations dynamically adapting to real-time on-chain states. It ensures orchestrations complete fully or revert entirely, protecting against state changes, MEV, front-running, and partial executions. Its proprietary AIVM leverages specially trained AI models designed for deterministic orchestration under decentralized consensus, establishing a uniquely secure, trustless execution environment for dynamic AI-driven workflows.
