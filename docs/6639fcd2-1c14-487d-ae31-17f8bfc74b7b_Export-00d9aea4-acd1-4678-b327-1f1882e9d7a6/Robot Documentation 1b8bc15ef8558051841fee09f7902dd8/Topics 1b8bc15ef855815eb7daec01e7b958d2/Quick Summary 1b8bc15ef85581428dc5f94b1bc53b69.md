# The First Blockchain Operated by AI

<aside>

The only VM that can deliver on AI’s wildest imagination, unleashing complex, trustless orchestrations.

**Can’t Be Replicated on Solana, Avalanche, Near or Sui**

The Robot Network is a unique integration of three AI systems: 

- **Copilot** for decision-making and user interaction
- **AI Virtual Machine** (AIVM)—a proprietary, trained AI that creates deterministic orchestrations.
- Off-chain **Robot Agents** (supporting third-party integrations) for automation and trigger events.

It’s unparalleled because its Natural Language Index (NL Index) provides real-time, on-chain context for these AIs to “see” and act, leaving other blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and Sui in the dark. Secondly, the AIVM enables deterministic, complex, atomic orchestrations for unmatched use cases—capabilities not possible with other blockchains’ architectures.
