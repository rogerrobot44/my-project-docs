# The Robot Copilot

The Robot Copilot is a powerful AI-powered interface built around a multi-billion parameter language model, specifically fine-tuned for the Robot Blockchain environment. It serves as your intelligent assistant, enabling natural language interactions to query blockchain state, deploy contracts, and execute transactions. The Copilot understands smart contracts, orchestrations, and real-time state data through the Natural Language Index (NLI), providing a seamless bridge between user intent and blockchain execution.

- Getting Started with the Copilot
    
    The Copilot interface integrates directly with your crypto wallet, ensuring all interactions are secure and authenticated. When you first connect, your wallet is embedded into the interface, and all intents generated through the Copilot are cryptographically signed before submission to the network. This preserves security while wrapping complex blockchain operations in an intuitive, conversational interface.
    
- Prompt Authoring
    
    The Copilot accepts natural language prompts to execute blockchain operations. Whether you're asking about current DAO votes or creating automated payment systems, the Copilot translates your expressions into structured intents that can be executed on the blockchain. The system is bounded by the contents of the NLI, ensuring all recommendations are based on actual blockchain state rather than assumptions.
    
- Identifying Wallet Addresses
    
    Through the Address Book feature, the Copilot helps manage and identify wallet addresses by allowing you to assign memorable names to cryptographic addresses. This makes transactions more intuitive, as you can reference saved addresses by their custom names rather than dealing with long hexadecimal strings.
    
    To identify a wallet address by name, simply type an at sign (@) to type-ahead the name of the wallet. The Copilot will automatically and securely translate that specific name into the appropriate hexadecimal string. 
    
- Identifying Contracts
    
    The Wallet ensures easy and unambiguous interactions with ERC-20 contracts by translating the Contract names into their hexadecimal strings automatically. To identify an address by name, in the prompt box simply type an a hash sign (#) to type-ahead the name of the contract.
    
- Sample Prompts
    
    Below are three  simple sample prompts that include the main building blocks of the Robot Copilot: Natural language, Wallet identification, Contract identification, Policies and Transactions.
    
    - "Show me the current balance of @AliceWallet"
    - "Deploy a new AMM contract with a maximum swap size of 1000 tokens"
    - "Transfer 100 tokens from #TokenContract to @DAOTreasury‚Äù
