In Solana\u2019s Sealevel runtime, each transaction lists the accounts it will read/write before execution, allowing non-overlapping transactions to run concurrently \ufffc. Similarly, Sui\u2019s object-centric model forces every object used in a transaction to be specified in the transaction input. This explicit encoding of dependencies lets Sui execute independent transactions in parallel. The upshot is that the blockchain can schedule transactions in parallel only when their data access is known in advance, avoiding conflicts.</p> <p>Impact on real-time AI-driven automation</p> <p>This static upfront requirement can constrain real-time, dynamic automation by on-chain AI. An AI agent or smart contract on Solana/Sui cannot spontaneously read or affect new state that wasn\u2019t pre-declared, meaning it can\u2019t adapt on the fly to data that emerges mid-execution. All relevant accounts/objects must be decided beforehand. If an AI-driven process needs to react to unpredictable events or fetch new info during execution, it would be forced into multiple transactions (with off-chain logic in between), rather than one atomic on-chain action. In essence, Solana and Sui\u2019s execution model favors determinism and parallel throughput over flexibility \u2013 a trade-off that could hinder real-time AI automation that requires on-the-spot decisions. Solana\u2019s programs, for example, can only access data that was loaded into the transaction at launch; an on-chain program cannot pull in additional accounts once execution has started \ufffc. This ensures determinism but means an AI can\u2019t, say, query a new contract mid-transaction based on some newly computed insight.</p> <p>Handling dynamic state changes</p> <p>Both protocols enforce consistency by disallowing unexpected state access and carefully ordering any conflicting transactions. In Solana, the runtime will prevent two transactions that write to the same account from executing in parallel \u2013 they\u2019ll be serialized or one will fail, preserving atomicity. Each transaction sees a snapshot of its specified accounts, and any changes to those accounts from earlier transactions are visible only if those transactions executed first (otherwise, conflicts are resolved by not running them concurrently). In Sui, if a transaction involves a shared object (global state that many might use), it cannot be run in parallel with other transactions on that same object \u2013 those go through consensus and execute sequentially. Only transactions on independent objects bypass global consensus and run truly concurrently. This means dynamic state changes (e.g. two actors trying to update the same asset at once) are handled by falling back to ordering one after the other. Neither Solana nor Sui allows a single transaction\u2019s scope to dynamically expand during execution \u2013 any state not pre-included is off-limits, and any unforeseen contention with other transactions will be resolved by scheduling (or aborting) rather than letting state updates conflict.</p> <p>Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from fixed data fixation</p> <p>This fixed transaction data fixation renders these blockchains vulnerable to mid-execution state changes, either naturally occurring or maliciously induced. An arbitrage orchestrated via sequential transactions becomes susceptible to price fluctuations or state manipulations mid-process. Additionally, partial completion of multi-step orchestrations due to non-atomic transactions creates exposure to MEV attacks, front-running, and unintended execution failures. Furthermore, pre-defined data significantly restricts the blockchain\u2019s adaptability, limiting responsiveness to emergent opportunities and compromising security.</p>"},{"location":"Research/#ethereum-and-avalanche","title":"Ethereum and Avalanche","text":"<p>Publicly available ABIs</p> <p>In Ethereum (and similarly on Avalanche\u2019s C-Chain, which inherits the EVM model), only a minority of smart contracts have their Application Binary Interface (ABI) openly available \u2013 typically those whose source code has been verified and published on explorers like Etherscan or SnowTrace. The vast majority of deployed contracts do not expose an ABI publicly. In fact, studies indicate over 99% of Ethereum contracts have never released their source code (and by extension, no public ABI), leaving only a tiny percentage with human-readable interfaces\ufffc. </p> <p>Avalanche\u2019s default chain doesn\u2019t inherently improve this statistic, as it relies on the same voluntary verification process. This means an AI agent looking to interact with arbitrary contracts is often flying blind without an ABI, unless developers have provided that metadata. In practice, AI-driven orchestration on Ethereum/Avalanche would be mostly limited to known contracts with published ABIs or require off-chain ABI reverse-engineering.</p> <p>Deterministic AI-driven orchestration limits</p> <p>Ethereum and Avalanche\u2019s architectures were not designed with native AI orchestration in mind, and they impose certain deterministic but rigid patterns that an AI must work within. Both use a globally sequential execution of transactions (Ethereum\u2019s single-threaded EVM execution, and Avalanche\u2019s Snowman consensus ordering on its C-Chain), so complex multi-contract workflows have to be broken into discrete transactions or encoded into a single contract call. There is no built-in scheduler or multi-step transaction framework in the base protocol that an AI can leverage for \u201cdeterministic orchestration\u201d across contracts \u2013 any orchestration logic must be handled at the smart contract or application layer. </p> <p>For example, an AI agent could deploy an Ethereum smart contract that calls a series of other contracts in one transaction (achieving atomicity for that sequence), but it would need all those contract ABIs and to predefine the call sequence. Or, the AI could send multiple transactions and try to coordinate them, but then it\u2019s subject to network latency, mempool ordering, and other actors\u2019 interference. The net effect is that while the outcome of a single transaction is deterministic, orchestrating longer sequences of actions deterministically is challenging. Each transaction\u2019s state changes finalize before the next begins, and interleaving external data or triggers in the middle isn\u2019t possible without breaking out to off-chain logic. </p> <p>In short, Ethereum and Avalanche provide a stable, deterministic execution for individual transactions, but they inherently limit an AI\u2019s ability to coordinate complex, stateful workflows in a single, seamless operation. Any cross-contract or multi-step AI-driven process will either be one atomic transaction (if pre-planned and encoded) or will require off-chain coordination (sacrificing atomicity).</p> <p>Real-time data access for AI applications</p> <p>On-chain contracts on Ethereum and Avalanche cannot directly access real-time external data or make network calls in the midst of execution. All information used by a smart contract must be on-chain (either already stored in state or provided as part of the transaction call data). This is a deliberate design for determinism \u2013 every node must see the same inputs and compute the same result. Consequently, any off-chain data needed (prices, sensor readings, AI model outputs, etc.) has to be fed on-chain via oracles or external transactions. </p> <p>\u201cEthereum contracts cannot communicate directly with the outside world,\u201d as the classic oracle problem statement goes\ufffc. They rely on oracle services (like Chainlink or custom feeders) to push in data at intervals. This means an AI application that needs up-to-the-moment information (say, a latest market price or an IoT sensor reading) can\u2019t pull that data in real-time during a contract\u2019s execution \u2013 it must wait for an oracle update transaction that delivers the data to the blockchain.</p> <p>Avalanche\u2019s contracts share this limitation, as they run the EVM; they too must use oracles for fresh data. There\u2019s also no native mechanism for continuous real-time computation on-chain \u2013 contracts execute only when triggered by a transaction, and then they run to completion. For AI use cases, this implies that any real-time processing loop or reactive behavior has to be implemented with a series of transactions and off-chain components. </p> <p>In summary, Ethereum and Avalanche ensure deterministic execution and state consistency but at the cost of needing off-chain assistance for live data and any ongoing autonomous activity. AI agents on these platforms typically operate by observing on-chain state and submitting transactions (much like a human user would), rather than by residing on-chain and reacting instantaneously.</p> <p>Vulnerabilities and limitations arising from sequential execution</p> <p>Sequential execution allows intervening state changes, exposing orchestrations to external manipulation, price fluctuations, or malicious front-running between sequential steps. The lack of atomicity across multi-transaction orchestrations increases vulnerability to MEV exploits, front-running, and partial transaction failures.

In practical terms, NEAR claims support for on-chain AI agents that can manage assets and execute tasks on behalf of users.

These Shade Agents are essentially a network of secure nodes that can run arbitrary machine learning models or heavy computations off-chain in a verifiable, confidential manner\ufffc. The results from these computations can then be validated and used on-chain, combining off-chain AI power with on-chain trust. In short, NEAR is building an ecosystem where AI-driven dApps can thrive: it markets itself as AI-ready, with features like a sharded, scalable runtime for high throughput, and specialized frameworks (like an AI Assistant and an Agent Protocol) to ease development of AI agents. NEAR\u2019s website explicitly mentions \u201cAI agents manage assets and services autonomously,\u201d underscoring its intent to natively support autonomous automation\ufffc.

NEAR is essentially adding AI-friendly components around its core protocol \u2013 e.g. off-chain compute via Shade Agents, cross-chain intent handling, and giving AI agents the ability to submit transactions \u2013 but the actual smart contract execution on NEAR remains the typical deterministic but single-transaction model.</p> <p>Complex AI tasks on NEAR might involve multiple steps: an off-chain agent (or TEE cluster) plans or computes, then on-chain contracts execute moves (with each transaction being atomic). By contrast, since The Robot Network\u2019s deterministic orchestration allows it to coordinate multi-step AI-driven workflows entirely within the blockchain environment in a predictable sequence, it means that The Robot Network can execute an AI agent\u2019s series of actions atomically (all-or-nothing) and under consensus, rather than relying on off-chain components between steps. </p> <p>NEAR\u2019s AI agents, while powerful, do not all run within the on-chain VM from start to finish \u2013 they often operate as off-chain services that trigger on-chain transactions. The use of TEEs on NEAR underscores this: heavy AI computations are done off-chain (albeit in a verifiable way) and then the outcome is injected on-chain\ufffc. This is a different design philosophy from a blockchain that would run the AI logic on-chain deterministically. Therefore, NEAR\u2019s AI integration is more hybrid \u2013 combining on-chain and off-chain \u2013 whereas The Robot Network\u2019s atomic execution keeps the entire process within the blockchain\u2019s deterministic context. </p> <p>Also, NEAR\u2019s focus is on scalability and flexibility (sharding, bridging, external compute) to accommodate AI, whereas The Robot Network\u2019s atomic execution ensures that the AI-driven process is executed in one go under unified consensus. </p> <p>In summary, NEAR provides many tools for AI, but it doesn\u2019t inherently make multi-step processes a single atomic unit across the chain and beyond \u2013 that is a distinguishing feature of The Robot Network design. NEAR\u2019s advantage is in offering infrastructure for AI (sharded throughput, agent frameworks, etc.), but the trade-off is that it leans on external modules for orchestration, as opposed to a fully on-chain deterministic sequence of The Robot Network.</p> <p>Dynamic, real-time AI-driven automation on-chain</p> <p>NEAR does not yet support dynamic real-time AI automation as a native on-chain service in the way one might imagine an AI agent continuously running on the blockchain. Like most chains, NEAR\u2019s contracts execute in response to transactions and cannot initiate themselves on their own schedule. There\u2019s no built-in cron-like trigger or continuously learning AI model running inside the NEAR runtime without external intervention. NEAR\u2019s roadmap and ecosystem tools acknowledge this by providing external solutions: for instance, projects like CronCat (a scheduling DAO/tool) have been introduced to schedule contract calls on NEAR, indicating that timed or automated triggers come from add-ons rather than the base protocol. </p> <p>When NEAR speaks of \u201cAI agents\u201d managing things, those agents are essentially off-chain programs (or users running code) that utilize NEAR\u2019s fast finality and cheap transactions to act quickly \u2013 but they still must submit transactions to effect change. In terms of real-time responsiveness, NEAR\u2019s 1-2 second block finality is an improvement over slower chains, meaning an AI agent can react and get confirmation of an action within a couple of seconds, which is near real-time for many applications. However, this is not the same as the AI logic living on-chain and updating continuously in real-time. </p> <p>NEAR\u2019s Shade Agents provide a form of real-time compute environment, but it\u2019s off-chain (in a TEE cluster) and then feeds results on-chain in a verifiable way\ufffc. Thus, while NEAR is AI-friendly, an AI-driven automation loop (sense-decide-act) still straddles off-chain and on-chain components. The on-chain part (NEAR smart contracts) remains deterministic and requires transactions to initiate changes, just like Ethereum or others. There is no native on-chain mechanism for an AI to, for example, continuously monitor a sensor feed and adjust itself every block without external input \u2013 that kind of \u201clive\u201d automation would require an external agent watching the sensor and sending transactions to NEAR. </p> <p>In contrast, a platform like The Robot Network, which supports deterministic orchestration and atomic execution natively, allows an AI routine to run as a sequence of on-chain steps triggered by on-chain events in one go. NEAR\u2019s current offerings would require the AI to break that into parts, using off-chain triggers (even if automated) for each step. </p> <p>To summarize, NEAR greatly aids AI applications with its scalability and dedicated tooling (making it easier to integrate AI and blockchain), but it does not natively provide a fully on-chain, self-driving AI automation engine.

These nodes execute the computationally demanding AI workloads off-chain, subsequently returning results alongside cryptographic proofs or attestations. Smart contracts on Ritual validate these proofs on-chain before accepting the results into the blockchain state, creating a verified bridge between off-chain AI computation and on-chain state updates.

Introduction","text":"<p>The Robot Blockchain and Network is a new foundation for decentralized software - one that brings intelligence and autonomy to the blockchain layer itself. By combining the rigor and trustlessness of cryptography with the flexibility and intuition of AI, Robot enables users to express intents in natural language, and have those intents orchestrated, validated, and executed by an intelligent, decentralized system.</p> <p>Today\u2019s smart contracts are rigid, low-level, and inaccessible to most users. Their complexity favors experts and creates silos of capability-requiring developers to encode behavior in code, and users to trust interfaces they cannot verify. This separation of concerns, while necessary in traditional systems, breaks the promise of direct ownership and autonomy that blockchain was meant to deliver.</p> <p>AI, meanwhile, has revolutionized how humans interact with machines. Language models have enabled people to interact with software not as users of tools, but as collaborators. Yet AI systems remain dependent on centralized infrastructure and opaque execution paths-limiting their trustworthiness and programmability.</p> <p>Robot resolves these tensions by embedding intelligence directly into the decentralized execution fabric. The network is built around natural language smart contracts, which are written, understood, and reasoned about in human language. Every contract and state change is published in real time to a Natural Language Index (NLI) optimized for large language models (LLMs), allowing AI systems to reason over the blockchain\u2019s live state.</p> <p>Users interact with the network through the Robot Copilot, a powerful AI interface backed by a multi-billion parameter language model. The Copilot has an embedded wallet and signs all intents, ensuring cryptographic integrity and user authorization. Intents submitted via the Copilot are interpreted by the AI Virtual Machine (AI VM), which composes orchestrations-collections of smart contracts and policies-that fulfill the user\u2019s goal.</p> <p>These orchestrations can be executed atomically, dynamically, and even in parallel-a departure from traditional blockchains where execution is rigid, serial, and pre-fixed. The system is extensible through Robot Agents, which operate off-chain to gather data or trigger events, all while participating in the trust boundary defined by the AI VM and the NLI.</p> <p>In this way, the Robot Blockchain and Network doesn\u2019t just bring AI to blockchain - it trustlessly integrates AI into the very logic of decentralized execution, enabling a future where intelligent agents and autonomous systems can interact, collaborate, and execute with the same guarantees of trust and ownership that blockchains were always meant to provide.</p>"},{"location":"Whitepaper/#2-user-experience-the-robot-copilot","title":"2.

Traditional EVM-based blockchains, like Ethereum, are constrained by single-threaded execution, capping transaction per second (TPS) rates at levels insufficient for mass adoption\u2014often in the tens or low hundreds. This limitation stifles the potential of decentralized applications (dApps) requiring high-speed, high-volume processing, such as derivatives trading, gaming, or real-time data systems. At Robot, we\u2019ve identified an opportunity to address this bottleneck by designing the Robot Network, a scalable, EVM-compatible blockchain that leverages parallel execution to achieve orders-of-magnitude higher TPS, without sacrificing the robustness or familiarity of the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1 Built as a layer-2-inspired hybrid with sharding, it uses a dual-chain structure\u2014Settlement Layer Subnet and State Chain\u2014where validators shard execution and contribute to both settlement finality and state updates, paired with a sharded NLI.</p> <p>The Robot Parallel Execution Architecture emerges from building on the Avalanche Subnet-EVM framework. We initially developed the Natural Language Index (NLI) to enhance AI integration, making smart contract interactions more intuitive and powerful. Now, we see an opportunity to utilize the NLI to accelerate our EVM-based execution and settlement, driving the Robot Network\u2019s performance to new heights. Our goals are to:</p> <ul> <li>Scale Throughput: Target millions of TPS for enterprise-grade dApps.</li> <li>Preserve EVM Compatibility: Retain Solidity and Ethereum tooling for developer adoption.</li> <li>Enhance Redundancy: Ensure fault tolerance at high speeds.</li> <li>Optimize State Management: Deliver real-time state access with fast settlement.</li> </ul> <p>This architecture achieves a theoretical TPS limit of 3.2M with 100 validators, scaling linearly to 16M with 500 validators, significantly outpacing Sui\u2019s tested 100K\u2013500K TPS ceiling, which relies on object-based parallelism and scales with object diversity rather than validator count.
